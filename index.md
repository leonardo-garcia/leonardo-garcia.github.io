Hi, my name is Leonardo G.

My pronouns are He/Him/His 🏳️‍🌈

I'm a software engineer, and I'm currently working at Wizeline, where I've learned a lot, not only by participating in the development and planning of a number of projects but also from my colleagues.

I speak 3 languages. Spanish is my native one. English is my second language. I enjoy using it every day in and out of work. French is my third one, and currently, I'm taking lessons to acquire the upper intermediate level (B2).

Outside of work, I love to learn new things. I have learned to play tennis, to skate, to do yoga, to meditate, and I have enjoyed the most to learn how to do some photography.

My interests are human computer interaction, user experience, augmented reality, image processing and computer vision.
